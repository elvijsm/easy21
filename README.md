# easy21
This repository contains code for applying reinforcement learning to the game of Easy21.

Easy21 is a variation of Blackjack and served as an assignment in the UCL course on RL by David Silver in 2015.

The course website containing links to video lectures, slides, and the description of the assignment is https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/.

Note that I have never taken part or been affiliated with the course at UCL, so there are no guarantees as to the correctness of this code. I just followed the lectures and had a bit of fun with reinforcement learning.

To get started, have a look at the first 50 lines of easy21.py or run its main method.

Edit the global parameter `DO_ASSIGNMENT` to run simulations for the assignment, `RUN_EXAMPLES` to run multiple example simulations with different parameters and algorithms, and set `SAVE_PLOTS` to True to save figures before running the main method.

The ./img folder contains the outputs when the main method is run with all three parameters set to true.
